<p>This is the typical case, where a managed device is granted a seat. It is a relatively simple process, since trust is already established with the device. User should poll the individual member to check licensing status</p>

<h4 id="license-an-unmanaged-device-by-adding-it-to-the-purchased-pool-license.">3. License an unmanaged device by adding it to the purchased pool license.</h4>
<p>Since managing a device can be a somewhat expensive operation, BIG-IQ has the ability to grant licenses to unmanaged devices. This allows supporting thousands of grants. However, licensing operations for unmanaged grants require different inputs â€” instead of a deviceReference, expected fields are an IP address, username and password. User should poll the individual member to check licensing status</p>
