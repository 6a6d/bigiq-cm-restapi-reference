<h2 id="initial-activation-of-license">Initial Activation of license</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Using the BIG-IQ REST API, you can activate a BIG-IP license of various types. This endpoint is the common starting point for activating a Pool-style regkey (e.g.: Utility License, Volume License, etc.). Clients use this endpoint to perform the initial activation of the top-level regkey, then they perform all other license actions in the relevant collection.</p>
<p>For automatic activation, the system will obtain license text from the F5 server without user intervention. For manual activation, the client will be provided with a dossier, which they must then activate at the F5 licensing web portal. The client obtains license text there, and inputs it back in this collection in order to complete this manual activation step. Note: Automatic activation would typically involve requiring the user to accept EULA text before proceeding. For manual activation, this happens on the web portal.</p>
<p>Once license text is obtained, this worker will determine what kind of license it represents. Using that information, it will create an entry in the appropriate specific license collection. For instance, a purchased pool License regkey would result in an entry being created in /cm/device/licensing/pool/purchased-pool/licenses.</p>
<p>A Reference to the item in that collection will be stored, and made available to the client.</p>
<p>For the case of automatic activation, this worker will wait for the activation process to finish in the specific collection. This would typically be a multi-step process, as each offering will need to be activated. Eventually, either success or failure will be encountered, and that information will be propagated to the user. In this way, for automatic activation, the client need not perform any additional action other than the initial POST, and then wait for the result.</p>
<p>For manual activation, the process is necessarily more involved. As before, an item will be created in the relevant license collection based on the initial license text. However, for manual activation, this worker will be done at that point. The client must go visit that collection (through the provided Reference) and complete manual activation there. The client will need to use that license collection's specific API to finish manual activation</p>
